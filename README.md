# AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System

This project implements an AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that classifies network traffic to detect web attacks. It uses a Random Forest classifier with SMOTE for handling imbalanced data and provides a web interface built with Flask for easy predictions and deployment.

---

## Features

- Data preprocessing and handling class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Training a Random Forest classifier with feature scaling.
- Saving and loading the model pipeline for inference.
- Command-line scripts for training and prediction.
- Flask web framework to serve the application backend and provide REST APIs or web pages.
